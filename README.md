# MERN STACK CHATROOM
This is a chatroom created with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).<br/>

The server is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server that was created the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as database.<br/>

The client was create via the [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and some [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).<br/>

Communication between the client and the server is done using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) and websockets, specifically [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/).<br/>

The passwords from the register form are encrypted using [b-crypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) and then are sent to the database.<br/>

There are some [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) implementations. In the future i will intergrate [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to control all states of the components.
